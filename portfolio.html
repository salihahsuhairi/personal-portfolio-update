<p style="text-align: center;">I am so happy to be able to work with the kids and really make a difference in their lives. Being a teacher is who I am and what I have always wanted. I remember that I was very disappointed in class because I did not understand what was being discussed in class. A dedicated teacher helped me by realizing my learning disabilities and finding ways to help me. I am indebted to the success of this incredible teacher who changed my life. That experience made me feel like I am now and now I am helping others. I love my job and I am so proud to be in this position that makes a difference.

<p style="text-align: justify;">I come into this profession with a definite belief related to who I will be as a successful teacher, employee, and member of your community. I am a most important teacher encompassing the development of a trustworthy environment with my students. In my opinion, students are only open to learning beyond the limits of basic needs when trust exists. One of the skills I will use in building the environment mentioned earlier is the ability to communicate with students efficiently. I will not only provide educational data from the curriculum, but I am a good listener who is willing to respond to all ideas put forward by the classroom community. I will also respond well to open changes to learning from others in trying new approaches in the construction and delivery of lessons.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of my teaching methodology is to inspire content learning as well as develop the skills needed for students to explore content and make smart conclusions independently. I am committed to inspiring this critical exploration by stimulating teamwork among peers, recognizing different learning styles, teaching across subject boundaries, providing individual accommodation, engaging students in goal setting where appropriate, and being able to recognize and seize moments when teachable moments occur. All of these approaches can be nurtured through creative lesson planning.</p>
